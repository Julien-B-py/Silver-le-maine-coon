## Silver-le-maine-coon

This back-end project was about building my first personal website using **Express**.

I recently got a Maine Coon kitten so it was the perfect opportunity to apply my knowledge and practice some new skills.

In association with **Express** I also used:

<ul><li>Mongoose</li><li>Passport to handle Facebook login</li><li>ImageKit API to upload and serve optimized images.</li> 
  </ul>
